# Cybersecurity Assessment Report

**Client:** [NEC Corporation]  
**Date:** [June 20, 2024]  
**Prepared by:** [Andrey B. Babol] and [Arlan B. Imperial]

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Overview
This report details the findings from the cybersecurity assessment conducted for [NEC Corporation]. The assessment aimed to uncover vulnerabilities in various areas of the company's digital infrastructure.

### 1.2 Methodology
The assessment included:
- Penetration Testing
- Vulnerability Scanning
- Security Audits

## 2. Findings
### 2.1 Application Security Vulnerabilities
- **Critical:** Insecure direct object references found in [Application Name], allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **High:** Lack of input validation in [Application Name] API, potentially leading to SQL Injection attacks.

### 2.2 Database Security Vulnerabilities
- **Critical:** Use of default database credentials in [Database Name], risking unauthorized access and data compromise.
- **High:** Lack of encryption for sensitive data stored in [Database Name], exposing it to potential theft.

### 2.3 Cloud Infrastructure Vulnerabilities
- **Critical:** Misconfigured AWS S3 bucket permissions, allowing public access to confidential documents.
- **High:** Absence of logging and monitoring for AWS EC2 instances, hindering detection of suspicious activities.

### 2.4 Endpoint Security Vulnerabilities
- **Critical:** Outdated antivirus definitions on company laptops, leaving them vulnerable to new malware strains.
- **High:** Lack of full disk encryption on employee mobile devices, risking data exposure in case of loss or theft.

### 2.5 Physical Security Vulnerabilities
- **High:** Unauthorized access detected in the server room due to insufficient access controls and CCTV coverage gaps.
- **High:** Lack of secure disposal procedures for outdated hardware, potentially leaking sensitive information.

### 2.6 Network Security Vulnerabilities
- **Critical:** Lack of segmentation in the internal network, potentially allowing lateral movement by attackers.
- **High:** Outdated firmware and unpatched vulnerabilities in network devices, exposing them to exploitation.

### 2.7 Social Engineering and Phishing
- **High:** Employees falling victim to phishing attacks, leading to unauthorized access to corporate systems and data breaches.

### 2.8 Incident Response and Management
- **Critical:** Inadequate incident response plan with unclear roles and responsibilities during security incidents.
- **High:** Lack of regular tabletop exercises to test and improve incident response procedures.

### 2.9 Compliance and Regulatory Issues
- **High:** Non-compliance with industry standards (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS) regarding data protection and privacy, potentially resulting in legal and financial penalties.

### 2.10 Third-Party Security Risks
- **High:** Insufficient monitoring and assessment of security practices among third-party vendors and service providers, posing risks to data integrity and availability.

## 3. Recommendations
### 3.1 Application Security
- **Action 1:** Implement access control mechanisms to prevent direct object references.
- **Action 2:** Validate and sanitize inputs in the API to prevent SQL Injection.

### 3.2 Database Security
- **Action 1:** Change default database credentials and enforce strong authentication.
- **Action 2:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit within the database.

### 3.3 Cloud Infrastructure
- **Action 1:** Configure AWS S3 buckets to restrict access and enable encryption.
- **Action 2:** Implement logging and monitoring for AWS EC2 instances to detect unauthorized activities.

### 3.4 Endpoint Security
- **Action 1:** Update antivirus software and definitions regularly on all endpoints.
- **Action 2:** Implement full disk encryption on all company-issued mobile devices.

### 3.5 Physical Security
- **Action 1:** Strengthen access controls to the server room and improve CCTV coverage.
- **Action 2:** Establish secure procedures for hardware disposal to ensure data security.

### 3.6 Network Security
- **Action 1:** Implement network segmentation to limit lateral movement and contain potential breaches.
- **Action 2:** Establish a robust patch management process to regularly update firmware and secure network devices.

### 3.7 Social Engineering and Phishing
- **Action 1:** Conduct regular security awareness training sessions to educate employees about phishing tactics and safe online behavior.
- **Action 2:** Implement email filtering and validation techniques to mitigate the risk of phishing attacks.

### 3.8 Incident Response and Management
- **Action 1:** Develop and document a comprehensive incident response plan outlining roles, responsibilities, and communication protocols.
- **Action 2:** Conduct regular tabletop exercises to simulate cyber incidents and improve response effectiveness.

### 3.9 Compliance and Regulatory Issues
- **Action 1:** Conduct a thorough assessment to identify gaps in compliance with relevant regulations and standards.
- **Action 2:** Implement measures to ensure ongoing compliance and avoid potential legal and financial repercussions.

### 3.10 Third-Party Security Risks
- **Action 1:** Establish clear security requirements in contracts with third-party vendors and conduct regular security assessments.
- **Action 2:** Monitor and audit third-party activities to ensure adherence to security policies and standards.

## 4. Conclusion
